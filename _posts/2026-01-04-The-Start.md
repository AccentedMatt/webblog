# Happy New Year Everyone! It's 2016 (plus another 10 years)

## A New website? 

So, you've stumbled here. Intrigued by what is happening or you're just another web-scraping bot. No worries. 


This year, I plan on writing at least one article a week on computer-related activities that I have been up-to, whether that
be a rant or an actually genuinely helpful tutorial. The idea of this is to help me keep track of what I have done and document
everything I have been doing for future reference. I was never good at keeping a personal diary of content so by doing a public
promise, I hope, that I can keep something going here.

## Why say "New website"?

Well, I had a website before but it was horrifically formatted and I never really took care of it so I abolished it off 
the face of the earth. It's still there on the wayback machine (much like the rest of the web) so if any of you want to have
a good chuckle at primary school level HTML, fire away. 

## This week

This week has been a busy one. With the start of the new year, I didn't get nearly as much stuff done as I would of liked
I set up this website using [jekyll-theme-yat](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat) and set it up to be statically 
hosted on github pages, luckily I'm finding that much easier to do than before. This also proved to be a good use of 
remembering how to navigate github as due to both my university studies and my JLPT exam (not to mention adding in work), 
I've neglected doing any big personal projects; that is something I hope to change this coming year. 

In the homelab, I finally made the move to make some of my east-west traffic encrypted. I was reading into using ACME but opted 
to do a local root authority as it just works out easier to manage (albeit, everyone has to install a certificate). It's nice to 
see the URL Bar stop screaming at me that it's "Not Secure" even when using some of my services native HTTPS. This HTTPS shenanigans
will be a re-occuring theme I think so let's hope I don't lose the root authority keys. Air-gapping doesn't stop stupidity of course.👀

Speaking of air-gapping, I imagine most of you know about Stuxnet by now. If not, here's a good read till we see each other again:
